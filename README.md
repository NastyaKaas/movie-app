# movie-app

This app can be used for searching for movies. The app makes a request to an external API to fetch a list of movies that will be displayed in a dropdown menu
or on the main screen (if a user presses the "Enter" button or clicks the "Search" button). She can then click on any movie to proceed to this movie's page.

The website is fully responsive for any device.

In the process of making the website, I learned how to get an average color of an image using Canvas API.
